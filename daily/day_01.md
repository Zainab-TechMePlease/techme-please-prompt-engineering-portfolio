##Reflections

##What worked

Audience adjustment: The explanations changed tone and complexity appropriately—using simple, concrete imagery for a child and technical phrasing for a college student.

Brevity: Each version delivered exactly three bullet points, keeping the format clear and easy to follow.

Structure: The organization into bullets made both explanations straightforward to scan and compare.

Extension options: Suggestions for analogies and real-world applications created opportunities to go deeper without overloading the main answer.

##What did not work

10-year-old version: The “everyone can see the notebook” idea was too abstract without tying it to familiar, everyday experiences such as a classroom whiteboard that no one is allowed to erase.

College version: Terms like “cryptographic hash” were included but not defined, which may lose readers outside computer science or mathematics.

Comparison step: The analysis highlighted stylistic differences but could have gone further by explaining the educational effectiveness of each approach.

##What to improve

Sharper analogies: Use widely relatable examples like school supplies, trading cards, or shared chores instead of niche hobbies such as video games.

Accessible technical depth: Introduce necessary technical terms for college readers but provide quick definitions so the meaning is clear.

Layered clarity: Offer a base explanation first, followed by optional detail for those who want a deeper dive.

Critique depth: Evaluate not only tone and style but also how well each explanation achieves understanding for its target audience.
